## CLEO Scripts

CLEO allows the installation of 'CLEO scripts', which often use the extension '.cs'. These third-party scripts are entirely user-made and are in no way supported by the developers of this library. While CLEO itself should work in a wide range of game installations, individual scripts are known to have their own compatibility restrictions and can not be guaranteed to work.
CLEO scripts can be found on Grand Theft Auto fansites and modding sites such as:

## Credits

Initially, CLEO was designed and made for San Andreas. The huge success of it and popularity of previous games inspired Alien to port the library for GTA 3 and Vice City, without some features, such as custom saves storing CLEO variables and scripts state. After Alien's retirement, the development slowed down until Silent issued a version with some fixes. Soon after that DK22Pac announced the next version of CLEO for GTA III and Vice City, written from scratch. It was never released, but ThirteenAG helped to finish his work and the second version is now available for download. 
Today the CLEO library is an open-source project being maintained at https://github.com/cleolibrary
